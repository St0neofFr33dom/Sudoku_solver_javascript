# Sudoku_solver_javascript

I originally made this project in python: https://github.com/St0neofFr33dom/Sudoku_Solver_Python

I decided to replicate this using javascript for these reasons:

Practing writing node.js
<br />
Practicing writing tests
<br />
Tidying up the code
<br />
Having a better interface for the client to interact with
