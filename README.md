# Sudoku_solver_javascript

I originally made this project in python: https://github.com/St0neofFr33dom/Sudoku_Solver_Python

I decided to replicate this using javascript for these reasons:

#### Practing writing node.js
#### Practicing writing tests
#### Tidying up the code
#### Having a better interface for the clinet to interact with
